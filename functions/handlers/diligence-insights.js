          UNDERSTANDING PDTF DATA:
          - You will receive "claims" data - these are individual verified data points from various sources
          - Each claim contains verification metadata showing the data source and trust level
          - Claims aggregate together to form the complete property transaction state
          - All data is provenanced and traceable to its original source

          You must perform this specific diligence check: "${check.name}"
          ${check.description}

          WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
          ${check.context.lookFor.map((item) => `- ${item}`).join("\n          ")}

          RISK ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:
          - LOW RISK: ${check.context.riskAssessment.low}
          - MEDIUM RISK: ${check.context.riskAssessment.medium}
          - HIGH RISK: ${check.context.riskAssessment.high}
          - CRITICAL RISK: ${check.context.riskAssessment.critical}

          GUIDANCE: ${check.context.guidance}

          Focus on identifying: ${check.riskFactors.join(", ")}

          Your response must be valid JSON with this exact structure:
          {
            "status": "pass|warning|fail",
            "riskLevel": "low|medium|high|critical",

            "relevantClaimIds": ["claim_id_1", "claim_id_2"]
          }

          CRITICAL: For the 'relevantClaimIds' array, ONLY include claim IDs that you DIRECTLY used to make your determination. This means:
          - Claims that contain the specific data you referenced in your findings
          - Claims that directly support your risk assessment
          - Claims that you would cite as evidence for your conclusions

          DO NOT include:
          - Claims you merely looked at but didn't use
          - Claims that are generally related but didn't influence your decision
          - All claims in a category - only the specific ones that shaped your analysis

          Be selective and precise. If you found no specific relevant claims, return an empty array [].

          Status guidelines:
          - pass: No issues found or only low-risk items that don't require action
          - warning: Medium-risk issues that should be noted and may require action
          - fail: High-risk or critical issues that require immediate attention`,

TRANSACTION OVERVIEW:
You are analyzing a property transaction using the Property Data Trust Framework (PDTF).

PDTF EXPLANATION:
- Claims are individual data points from verified sources (Land Registry, local authorities, etc.)
- Each claim has a path (like /propertyPack/address) showing where it fits in the overall data structure
- Claims aggregate together to build the complete property transaction state
- All data is provenanced - you can see exactly where each piece of information came from

SPECIFIC CHECK TO PERFORM:
${check.name}: ${check.description}

Focus particularly on: ${check.riskFactors.join(", ")}

DATA TO ANALYZE:

${stateInfo}

${claimsInfo}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review both the aggregated state and individual claims
2. Look for the specific issues mentioned in this check
3. Consider the provenance and reliability of the data sources
4. Identify any risks, inconsistencies, or issues
5. Provide practical recommendations for the conveyancer

Please analyze this data thoroughly for the specific check requested and return your findings in the required JSON format.`;
